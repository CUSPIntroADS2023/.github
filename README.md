### Course Description
This course builds the foundation of the skill set and tools necessary to address urban analytics problems with urban data. It starts with basic computational skills, statistical analysis, and good practices for data curation and coding, and further introduces a machine learning paradigm and a variety of common supervised and unsupervised learning tools used in urban informatics, including regression analysis, clustering, and classification. After this class, you should be able to formulate a question relevant to Urban Informatics, locate and curate an appropriate data set, identify and apply analytic approaches to answer the question, obtain the answer and assess it with respect to its certainty level as well as the limitations of the approach and the data. The course will also contain project-oriented practice in urban informatics, including relevant soft skills â€“ verbal and written articulation of the problem statement, approach, achievements, limitations, and implications.

### Prerequisite
While the course will include extensive coding and statistical practice starting from the very beginning, basic Python proficiency and understanding of the major probability and statistical concepts is a pre-requisite for taking the course. The only formal prerequisites for the course are the successful completion of the summer Urban Computing Skills Lab or having equivalent Python proficiency. Prior to the course, students should be able to read structured datasets in Python, create basic graphical representations of the data, and generate customary summary statistics, such as means, variances as well as distributions. While we will recap the above skills at the beginning of the class, the value of the course to students without any coding skills and any undergraduate coursework in statistics, econometrics, computer science, or the physical sciences may be limited without considerable individual effort.
